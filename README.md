# ETS Tracker

**ETS Tracker** is an interactive Python program that lets users explore Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) routes. Users can search for bus routes by selecting origin and destination stops, visualize the routes on a map, and see service disruptions as red markers. The program also allows loading, saving, and managing route, shape, and disruption data.

## How to Run:

1. Make sure the `data` folder is unzipped and located inside the `ETS Tracker` project folder.  
2. Run `ETS Tracker.py`.  
3. When prompted for a filename, press **Enter** to automatically load the default files from the `data` folder.  
4. Saving and loading pickled data works the same way — press **Enter**, and the code will respond with messages like `Data structures successfully written to data/etsdata.p.`  
5. Use the menu to:
   - Load route, shape, and disruption data (**must load all data first, before using the interactive map (option 9)**)
   - Print shape IDs or coordinates
   - Find the longest route shape
   - Save/load data
   - Launch the interactive map  
6. On the map, click **Search** or press **Enter** to find a route, and use **Clear Text** or **Clear Routes** to reset.  
7. Close the map window to return to the menu, then enter `0` to quit the program completely.

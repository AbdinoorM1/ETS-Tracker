# ETS-Tracker
ETS Tracker is an interactive Python program that lets users explore Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) routes. Users can search for bus routes by selecting origin and destination stops, visualize the routes on a map, and see service disruptions as red markers. The program also allows loading, saving, and managing route, shape, and disruption data.
